I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Graph Research Lab](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/) of ANU. My research focuses on graph representation learning, with a particular interest in enhancing the power and generalizability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold the position of Senior Software Engineer at [Data61@CSIRO](https://algorithm.data61.csiro.au/). Prior to commencing my PhD, I had the luck to work with the [StellarGraph](https://www.stellargraph.io/) team, where I contributed to various projects including the [open-source graph machine learning libary](https://www.stellargraph.io/library).

With extensive industry experience in software engineering, I have also worked across diverse domains such as data analysis, video/image processing, and medical care.
