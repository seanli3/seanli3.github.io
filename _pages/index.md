I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [Graph Research Lab](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/) of ANU. My research interest in graph representation learning, in particular how GNNs can be made more powerful and generalizable.

I am also a senior software engineering at [Data61@CSIRO](https://algorithm.data61.csiro.au/). Before starting my PhD, I worked in the [StellarGraph](https://www.stellargraph.io/) team and had the chance to contributed to various products including the [open-source graph machine learning libary](https://www.stellargraph.io/library).

I had many years of industry expeience working in software engineering, in fields inlcluding data analysis, video/image processing and medical care.
