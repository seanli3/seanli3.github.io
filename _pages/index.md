I am a graduate Ph.D. research in the [Graph Research Lab](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/) of ANU, led by A/Prof [Qing Wang](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/team/) and Prof. [Brendan McKay](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/team/). 
I am also supervised by Dr. [Dongwoo Kim](https://dongwookim-ml.github.io/) from POSTECH.

My research interests center around two main topics: (1) studying the foundations of geometric deep learning, especially the expressivity, generalization and optimization of graph machine learning; (2) Exploring the novel connections between between mathematical theories (e.g. graph theory) and machine learning to help designing more robust, powerful, and explainable models.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold the position of Senior Research Engineer at [Data61@CSIRO](https://algorithm.data61.csiro.au/). Prior to commencing my PhD, I had the luck to work with the [StellarGraph](https://www.stellargraph.io/) team, where I contributed to various projects including the [open-source graph machine learning libary](https://www.stellargraph.io/library).

With extensive industry experience in software engineering, I have also worked across diverse domains such as data analysis, video/image processing, and medical care.
